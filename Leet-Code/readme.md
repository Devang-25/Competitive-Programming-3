# Leet-Code Problem Solutions:
* The directory consist solution's to problems in [Leet-Code](https://leetcode.com) in C/C++ and Python with test cases.
* As Leet-Code platform doen't allow you to write the whole program that way you wanted rather you need to write the function which is shown to you in there editor. When you are looking at the solutions presented in this repository, I would suggest to understand the logic (commented in the source-code) and the function which you need to write on Leet-Code, in my solution I have marked that function which is actually solving the problem.
