# Leet-Code Problem Solutions:
* The directory consist solution's to problems in [Leet-Code](https://leetcode.com) in C/C++ and Python with test cases.
* As Leet-Code platform doesn't allow you to write the whole program rather you need to write the function which is shown to you in the Leet-Code editor.  
* When you are looking at the Leet-Code problem solutions presented in this repository, I would suggest you to understand the logic (commented in the source-code) for function which you need to write on Leet-Code, I have marked that function (in source-code) which needs to be written by you.
