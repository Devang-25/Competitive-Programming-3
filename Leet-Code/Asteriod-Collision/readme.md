*   You can refer to the problem statement:
[Asteroid Collision](https://leetcode.com/problems/asteroid-collision/).

*   When you run the above code, do remember that the program will ask you to **first enter an integer value for number of test-cases**, then it will ask for an **interger value for the size of the array**, and then you can enter the size of each asteroid with the sign which denotes its direction as defined in the problem statement. Refer to the comments section of the code for more information.
