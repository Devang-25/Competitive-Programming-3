# Problem Description:

Two strings are said to be anagrams of one another if you can turn the first string into the second by rearranging its letters.
For example, `table` and `bleat` are anagrams, as are `tear` and `rate`.
Your job is to write a function that takes in two strings as input and determines whether they're anagrams of one another or not.

Assumptions:
1. Your algorithm should be case-sensitive, i.e. `tenet` and `TENET` are different string.
2. Strings can be of different lengths.
3. A string is an anagram of itself.
4. All the letters of the string will be lower-case english alphabets.

**NOTE:**
* The `python` program file: `anagram_detection_another_solution_2.py` solution is based on a clever trick to check whether two strings are anagrams of each other or not. (Inspired by the [Fermat's Library Twitter Post](https://twitter.com/fermatslibrary/status/1275066521450975234?s=20)).
