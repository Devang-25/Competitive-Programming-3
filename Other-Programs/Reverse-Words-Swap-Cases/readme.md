# Problem Description
Design a program that takes a string consisting of words separated by whitespaces and returns a string containing all those words in reverse order such that all cases of letters in the orginal string are swapped i.e. lowercase letters becomes uppercases and vice-versa.

**Example:**  
Input = `"rUns dOg"`    
Reverse the word order and swap the case of all letters, then return the string i.e. Ouput = `"DoG RuNS"`
