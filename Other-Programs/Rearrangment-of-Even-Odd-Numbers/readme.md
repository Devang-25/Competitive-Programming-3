# Rearrangement of Even-Odd Number in a Sequence in Alternating Increasing Order.

#### Problem Statment
Given an array of integers (both `odd` and `even`),the task is to arrange them in such a way that `odd` and `even` values come in alternate fashion in non-decreasing order(ascending) respectively.

If the smallest value is `Even` then we have to print `Even-Odd` pattern.
If the smallest value is `Odd` then we have to print `Odd-Even` pattern.

**Note: Number of `Odd` elements must be equal to Number of `Even` elements in the input array.**
