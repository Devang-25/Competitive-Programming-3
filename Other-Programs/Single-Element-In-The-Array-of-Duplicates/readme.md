# Problem Description
Given an array of integers `A` where all number occurs twice except one number which occurs once, find the number.  
Your solution should ideally be in `O(n)` and use `O(1)` extra-space.  
 **Example:**  
`A = [7, 3, 5, 5, 4, 3, 4, 8, 8]`  
`Output: 7`  
`A = [1, 1, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 5, 6]`  
`Output: 3`  
`A = [1, 1, 3, 2, 3]`  
`Output: 2`  
`A = [3, 4, 5, 3, 4, 5, 6]`  
`Output: 6`  
`A = [1, 2, 2]`  
`Output: 1`
