# Problem Description

You are given three numbers `a, b, c`. You can substract `1` from any two of the provided three numbers. Your task is to determine the maximum number of operations such that after performing all the operations optimally, all three numbers are non-negative.  

**Input Format**  
* The first line contains `T` denoting the number of test-cases.  
* For each test case, the next line contains three space separated integers `a, b, c` respectively.  

**Output Format**  
For each test case print the maximum number of operations in the new line.  


**Constraints**  
```
1 <= T <= 100  
1 <= a, b, c <= 10^18.  
```
