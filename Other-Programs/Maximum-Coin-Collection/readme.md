# Problem Description
You are given a 2-D matrix where each cell represents number of coins in that cell. Assuming we start at cell `matrix[0][0]`, and can only move right or down, find the maximum number of coins you can collect when you reach the botton right corner.

**For Example:**
Given matrix:
```
0 3 1 1
2 0 0 4
1 5 3 1
```

The maximum coins we can collect is `0 + 2 + 1 + 5 + 3 + 1 = 12` coins.
